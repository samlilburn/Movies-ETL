# Movies-ETL
Extract, transfer, load 
The purpose of this exercise is to create an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data into existing tables. We refactored the code from this module to create one function that takes in three files—Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating data—and performs the ETL process by adding the data to a PostgreSQL database.
